# Password Generator App

This project was created as part of the [The Modern Angular Bootcamp (2020)](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-modern-angular-bootcamp/)
in order to demonstrate the basic features of the Angular framework through an application.

## Usage

This app generates a password of a user-given length, including only the types
of characters selected by the checkboxes. A password will not be generated
unless a valid length and at least one of the checkboxes is marked.

Once a valid length has been set and the types of characters desired to be
included in the password have been selected, the user may click the "Generate!"
button to show their new, randomly generated password consisting of the types
of characters they indicated to use.

## Character Sets

### Lower Case Letters

Include any of the following letters: "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

### Upper Case Letters

Include any of the following letters: "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"

### Digits

Include any of the following digits: "0123456789"

### Symbols

Include any of the following symbols: "!@#$%^&*()_-+"

Note: Some of these symbols may not be allowed on different
websites for valid passwords, while other websites require any password
to include at least one "special character" - like one of these "symbols."
